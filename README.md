# Bloodpoint Farming Macros!
Macros to help with the repetitive/tedious aspects of farming bloodpoints in Dead by Daylight!

> [!CAUTION]
> These macros are focused on reducing repetitive stress injures while farming--not competitive advantage. However, they are still at odds with the BHVR Terms of Use. Use them at your own risk.

## How to Use
1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download the latest macros at https://BloodpointFarming.github.io/Bloodpoint-Farming-Macros/Bloodpoint-Farming-Macros.zip
3. Extract *everything* in the zip file.
4. Open the .ahk files you want to run. (e.g. just double click them)
5. To turn off the macro, open your system tray > right click the macro > Exit

## General Macros
### Autospend
- F6 to purchase tagged items from the bloodweb using the [fast bloodweb tech](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/s/njguTZBODp).
  - ⚠️ this can cause DBD to bug out until restarted.
  - Disabled by default. Edit the macro to set `useBloodwebCycling := true` to enable.
- Demo: https://youtu.be/h3Yr9y5W7GU
- Supports 1080p and 1440p resolutions at 100% UI scale only. Run windowed at these resolutions if you need to. Disable filters if they interfere.
- Use [NightLight](https://nightlight.gg/desktop) to tag the icons you want prioritized from the 🟥 🟪 🟦 🟩 🟫 version of the [bloodpoint-farming-autospender icon pack](https://nightlight.gg/packs/bloodpointfarmingautospender). Untagged items are autopurchased.
  - Alternatively, manually manage the tagged icons in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dead by Daylight\DeadByDaylight\Content\UI\Icons`
- To reload icons, close and reopen the bloodweb. (If that doesn't work, Play > Learn to Play > Survivor Tutorial > Exit.)
- Purchase order is based off of the 5 colored tags: Pink > Purple > Blue > Green > Brown

- Pausing/resuming repair for up to 5 seconds is considered the same repair session (e.g. bounce tech, switching toolbox)
- Create pretty graphs in google sheets, excel, or your tool of choice

## Automatic Updates
Scripts automatically check for updates and ask to update when new fixes and macros are added.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Updating will overwrite the whole directory, including any macro changes or new files you've added.
> If you'd prefer to manage updates manually, `git clone https://github.com/BloodpointFarming/Bloodpoint-Farming-Macros.git` instead. Scripts will not auto-update if they're run from in a git repo.
